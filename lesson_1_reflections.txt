How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By watching the difference between the removed line and the new line made,we can see the difference in the new code and can find out the bug in new one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can check the progress of our code from the older one by comparing them and hence,we can see our improvement.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that you know whether you have saved a modified file or not.But a con is that you might not have a backup saved if you forgot to save the files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in a Git,there may be one or more files that are interdependent on each other,but in google docs ,there is only one file we are working at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to see all the changes made in that git repository.
    git diff can be used to see difference between any 2 repositories we want to.    

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By using version control,we can check our bugs which we might have introduced at some point and can remove them by it's use.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git for my Android app Development.
